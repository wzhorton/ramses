RAMSES stands for R's Auxiliary Mcmc System for Easy Sampling. It is an R package designed to expidite the coding process of bayesian hierarchical models that are fit using gibbs sampling and MCMC methods. This system is comparable in purpose to JAGS or NIMBLE except it takes full advantage of R's flexibility, allowing for custom sampling functions to be used with ease.

Edit (Sep 17 2018): Using RcppArmadillo may have been a mistake. Individual calculations are sped up, but the nature of MCMC loops might introduce an inefficiency by repeatedly transfering large objects back and forth between the R and C++ environments (this might not be technically correct). For the time being, RAMSES is not going to be supported. Instead, see my other repo named "warptk" which is similar in nature (almost like a sequel) but does not depend on any C++ code.

Edit (Sep 19 2018): A set of companion packages named "warptk" and "hortonlib" are in development that are R exclusive. Should the need for C++ arise, ramses may be ressurected. Previous errors and speed issues may have been due to bugs and inefficient computations on my part, however it is much easier to debug R code than C++ via Rcpp so it proved to be a useful exercise to retire ramses.
